# Blood_Bank_Management_System
This is a sample prototype for Blood bank management system. How
 we can manage donors , patients , Stock in the blood bank, 
ordering goods and medical appliances in the bank.

In order to use this, you have to first download Xammp Server and
in the htdocs folder there , you have to make a folder BBMS and place all the files there.

Xammp server will help you run the php scripts and pages

After that you have to setup the smtp server for mail service
and then you have to change the mail id and password accordinly.

In the Xammp/htdocs folder there will be an index.php file , delete that file

Then you have to start the xammp server, and go to localhost, there you will see
a lot of folders, click on dashboard and then on the top right you will have 
an option for phpMyAdmin. 

Click on phpMyAdmin

download BBMS.sql from the SQL_Database_tables and then in phpMyAdmin , add a new database named
as 'BBMS' (in caps without quotes). Import the downloaded BBMS.sql and you will get all the 
required tables and some data prefed in the tables.

Your setup is ready.

Now on your browser go again to localhost and now click on the BBMS folder
(or the name of folder you created in htdocs in the starting). 

The Website should be working.

You can explore it and may suggest changes 

A Power Point presentation is also uploaded in the github that will demonstrate the 
various featurs of this website.
